                <h2>Career Journey</h2>
                <p>My adoration  for Data Science didnt really begin as much as my many interests and curiosities slowly converged to one field. From my statistics and computer science course work to the first time I wrote a script to the many research papers I've read, I've slowly learned what I find interesting and what I'm best at. While at Ohio State, I built a strong foundation in Data Analytics and Economics. My experiences in BDAA organizing and conducting student led research, teaching lectures on machine learning and python, and taking on leadership roles gave me a wide berth of organizational experiences. While conducting research with Dr. Christian Blanco and Dr. Tanya Berger-Wolf, I learned what it meant to formulate a problem space and develop a plan to understand its inner workings. My business analytics internship at Amazon taught me how to operate in a massive organization and that I missed the science of data science. When moving to JPMorgan Chase I realized how fun becoming an expert in a subject was and how to advocate for the projects I believed in. All of this solidified my passions for Data Science and developing cutting-edge AI and machine learning solutions, from anomaly detection workflows to tailored LLM tools. Now, as I pursue my Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, I am excited to continue deepening my expertise and tackling the next generation of challenges in AI.</p>
                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>Currently, I am deeply fascinated in understanding how pre-trained genrative systems "think", how we can use math to measure and comprehend their latent understanding space, and how they will develop over time. </p>
